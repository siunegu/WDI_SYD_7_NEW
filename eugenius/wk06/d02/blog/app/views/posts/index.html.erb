<!-- 
You need to wrap that link with some sort of validation that checks whether the post exists.

What I would suggest, is instead of doing it like this, use the each loop on line 3 to get the link -->

<!-- Apart from that - all your tests where sweet.  
 -->
<%= link_to "Add Post", new_post_path %>
